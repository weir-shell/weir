# Spike Notes

## Spike 3 — Type declarations (2026-07-11, session 1)

**Built**: `type X = { ... }` / `type X = A of t | B` statements at the prompt, record literals, `match` with constructor/var/wildcard patterns (nested allowed), exhaustiveness + unreachable-arm warnings, session persistence. 83 tests.

**Done-when verified at the REPL**: declare `type Proc = Running of int | Stopped`, construct (`Running 42`), match, get span-underlined exhaustiveness warnings.

**Design decisions**:
- `TRecord` → `TNamed`: the parser can't know record-vs-union when reading a type name, so `Ty` holds just the name and `env.Types` maps to `TypeDef = Record | Union`. Mechanical rename through checker/builtins.
- Constructors enter `Values` as ordinary typed entries (`Running : int -> Proc`, `Stopped : Proc`), so construction is just application — no new checker rule, and constructor typos get did-you-mean hints for free. Runtime counterparts built by `Eval.constructorValues`; a redeclared union shadows its constructors, but old values still match (pattern checking resolves cases via the scrutinee's type def, not a global ctor table).
- Case identifiers must start uppercase (F# convention) — that's what disambiguates `PCase` from `PVar` in patterns.
- **The `|` ambiguity**: match arms vs pipe. Resolution: arm bodies parse with a second OPP that omits the `|` operator (`|>` stays legal); a failed arm parse backtracks, so a trailing `| double` after the last arm becomes a pipe of the whole match — coherent and tested. Arm bodies containing `let`/`fun`/nested `match` need parens. Real fix is the offside rule — Spike 6 question at the earliest.
- Record literals resolve nominally by exact field-name set; ambiguity (two records, same fields) is an error. Type ascription syntax is the eventual disambiguator if needed.
- Exhaustiveness is a separate pure pass (`Check.warnings : TypeEnv -> TypedExpr -> Warning list`) walking the typed tree — zero signature churn on infer/check, no writer-monad plumbing, trivially testable. Top-level coverage only: a case counts as covered when some arm has its constructor with an irrefutable argument; nested refutations are conservatively "not covered". Proper usefulness matrices parked.
- Non-exhaustive match is a warning, not an error (per plan) — so `match failure` at runtime is reachable and is a `failwith`, not an `unreachable`.

**Surprised**: constructors-as-env-entries made construction genuinely free — the entire "constructor table" is `checkDecl` extending Values. The `|` grammar collision was the only real fight, and backtracking arms turned it into a feature (pipe-after-match without parens).

**Verdict**: continue. → Spike 4 (streaming pipelines).

## Spike 2 — Typed interpreter over checked AST (2026-07-11, session 1)

**Built**: `Eval.fs` rewritten over `TypedExpr` — untyped Spike 0 eval deleted. Value domain grown: `VRecord` (name + field map), `VUnion` (shape only, constructed in Spike 3), `VSeq`. All type-impossible arms are `unreachable` calls. New `Builtins.fs`: each builtin is one `(name, Ty, Value)` entry, so the TypeEnv and value env derive from a single list and can't drift. `ls` is real (`Seq.delay` over cwd — fresh listing per enumeration), typed `seq<FileRow>`. 52 tests.

**Checker→interpreter handoff**: holds. Spike 1's acceptance expression evaluates over records (fake `ls` fixture in tests, real one in the REPL). All former "fails at runtime" tests are now "rejected at check time" tests — the runtime error class they covered is unreachable through the checked pipeline.

**Learned**:
- The gate exposed a Spike-0-era fixture as untypeable: `let add = fun a -> fun b -> ...` — let-bound bare lambdas can't infer in bidirectional checking without annotations. Not a bug; the idiomatic replacement is partial application of typed functions (`let staged = where (fun f -> ...)`), which infers fine and is more shell-like anyway. Parameter annotation syntax is the eventual fix if the limitation bites.
- Runtime type errors did disappear. What remains at runtime is honest: division by zero, IO failures. Those are not the checker's job.
- `VSeq` equality materializes both sides — fine for tests, will be a footgun with infinite seqs in Spike 4 (flagged there).
- `unreachable` messages name the checker guarantee they rely on — each one is a soundness assertion; if one ever fires, it points at the checker rule that lied.

**Surprised**: how mechanical this spike was after Spike 1 — the typed eval is *simpler* than the untyped one (no defensive error paths, just `unreachable`).

**Verdict**: continue. → Spike 3 (type declarations) or Spike 4 (streaming).

## Spike 1 — Bidirectional checker, nominal only (2026-07-11, session 1)

**Built**: spanned AST (`Expr = { Kind; Span }`), `Ty` (int-with-optional-measure/str/bool/fn/seq/record-by-name), `TypeEnv` (Values + Types), `infer`/`check` pair in `Check.fs`, typo hints via edit distance, REPL now typechecks before eval and prints caret-underlined span errors. 43 tests.

**Acceptance**: `ls | where (fun f -> f.Size > 1<mb>) | first 5` checks to `seq<FileRow>`; `f.Sze` rejected with span exactly on `Sze` + "Did you mean 'Size'?". Perf: ~µs per check, 10ms bound trivially met.

**Design decisions**:
- Binops promoted from desugared builtins to `EBinOp` — overloading (`+` on int/str, measure-preserving arithmetic) doesn't fit monomorphic env entries. `typeBinOp` is the single overload table.
- Builtins are monomorphic (`where : (FileRow -> bool) -> seq<FileRow> -> seq<FileRow>`); polymorphism deliberately absent, revisit with row polymorphism (parked).
- UoM = `TInt of string option`, equality by name, erased at runtime. `+`/`-`/comparison require same measure; `*`/`/` unitless only (no measure algebra).
- Lambdas don't infer, but two refinement rules cover the shell idioms: lambda applied to a known arg, and pipe-into-lambda (arg type flows into the param).
- `EField` carries the field's own span so typo errors point at `Sze`, not all of `f.Sze`.
- `==` not `=` for equality (avoids let ambiguity). Composite spans are unions of child spans; leaf tokens capture position before ws-skip.
- Spans compose via `Span.union`; retrofitting confirmed as the right fear — touching every parser production once was enough, but only because the AST was 8 cases.

**Surprised**: how little the bidirectional core is — `check` has 3 real rules (lambda, let, fallback-to-infer-and-compare). The complexity lives in `infer`'s per-node rules and error message quality, not the discipline itself.

**Verdict (provisional)**: checker felt tractable to write. GATE CONDITION: user line-by-line review of Check.fs pending — spike isn't closed until then.

## Spike 0 — Toy interpreter (2026-07-11)

**Built**: `Expr` DU (int/str/bool/var/let/lambda/app/pipe), FParsec parser, tree-walk eval/apply, REPL with persistent top-level `let`. 23 tests. `1 + 2 |> double` → 6 end to end.

**Learned**:
- FParsec's `OperatorPrecedenceParser` handles the whole binop/pipe layer; binops desugar to `EApp(EApp(EVar "+", l), r)` against builtin env entries, so eval has no operator special cases.
- Lambda/let-in must be *terms* of the OPP (not alternatives outside it) or they can't appear on a pipe RHS (`5 |> fun x -> x * x`). Greedy lambda body = F# semantics for free.
- `Value` can't derive structural equality once `VBuiltin of (Value -> Value)` exists — custom equality (structural for data, reference for functions) needed for test assertions. Will matter again for `VSeq` in Spike 4.
- FParsec error messages come with line/col and a caret out of the box — good omen for Spike 1 span work.

**Surprised**: nothing structural. Keyword-vs-identifier ambiguity (`true`, `fun`) needed the usual `attempt` + `notFollowedBy` dance.

**Verdict**: continue. Eval/apply shape clicks, FParsec workable. → Spike 1.
