# Backlog

(Moved from SEMANTICS.md at its retirement — planning residue never
belonged in a semantics document.)

0. ~~**Block effect-sequencing**~~ — done, and was already done when this
   note moved here from SEMANTICS.md: the sibling-sentinel ESeq spine
   ([D:seq-commit]/[D:sibling-sentinel]) sequences any unit expression
   mid-block, a non-unit line refuses with `[seq-unit]` ("bind it or
   print it" — the statement rule's discipline inside blocks, exactly as
   priced), and the fuzz invariant "block siblings and single-line ';'
   agree" pins it. Probe-confirmed 2026-08-28.
1. ~~**Measure algebra**~~ — superseded: **measures were removed
   entirely** (2026-07-18; see the tombstone section and the NOTES arc).
   The 2026-07-17 drop decision and the `no_unit_algebra` tripwire
   retired with them *and* the `*`/`/`-defaulting rule above.
(Done: backlog #1 and the exit-code policy — old #3 — landed as
`Seq.force` (né `collect`) and `complete`; see "Processes and the
session".)

(Done: comparison/boolean completeness — landed with `<>` inheriting `==`'s
equatability and short-circuit `&&`/`||`, as pre-committed.)
